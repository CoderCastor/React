//react is Library
//not a framework
//developed in 2013 by facebook engineers
//get open source in 2015

//problem ---> solution =>REACT
//when website going through much more changes then all elements get rendered again 
//it will rerendered those elements which are not changed because of this the entire website gets slow down
//to avoid this thing REACT gets developed

//hence facebook engineers developed virtual doms
//virtual dom changing/repainting only those things which are getting changed and not entire website
